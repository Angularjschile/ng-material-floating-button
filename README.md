material-floating-button
========================

Material design floating button action implementation for Angularjs. 

Made to be semantic, fast and easy to customize.
~~Shamelessly~~ inspired by action buttons from Google Inbox, Evernote and Path.

**Other versions**
- [Vanilla html](https://github.com/nobitagit/material-floating-button) (original, upstream version of the component)

See a demo [here](http://nobitagit.github.io/material-floating-button/).

Docs coming soon, in the meantime please refer to the [showcase](http://nobitagit.github.io/material-floating-button/showcase.html) for code and animations overview.
